I have been interested in Robotics since the first workshop in which  we had to make hand gesture controlled car and it was really intriguing for me . I am  interested in this gyrobot project this time as it's fascinating to see how it can move smoothly and make precise turns without falling over. I'm excited to learn more about how it works and how we can use it in different ways.Plus I became more interested in it when i saw that this is used in many daily life appliances and gadgets like microwave and drones , so i guess it will be really fun and knowledgeable project to work on. Moreover self balancing robots are incredibly cool so I really want to work on this project.
